# 🤔 What is Transpire.exe?
Transpire.exe is a trojan that has 20 payloads, incluiding GDI-Effects and Bytebeats. This trojan was made in C++ and this is my 1st GDI-Trojan, it overwrites the bootsector (MBR) to a Pac-Man game (but this part is skidded, i'm sorry about that).

# 😃 Fun fact
When it's on the final payload, Transpire starts to use 100% of CPU, it's a proposital payload, but it's very cool.

# 🚨 Important!!!
You need to download "vcomp140d.dll" and place it at the same folder as Transpire is in to it to make it works. If you want to run it use a Virtual Machine (I recommend <b>Windows XP</b>) or a Sandbox. Remembering that i'm not responsible for any damages to your machine. This malware shows flashing lights and loud sounds, so if you have a photosensitive disease like epilepsy, don't run this or watch any video about it for your security. And yes, the MBR is skidded, but try to ignore it, it's cool anyways...

# 💊 What is the difference about TranspireDestructive and TranspireSafe?
As the name says, TranspireDestructive is the version that includes the destruction. Overwriting the bootsector (MBR) to the Pac-Man Game. This version is recommended just for people that uses Virtual Machine or a Sandbox.    
  
TranspireSafe is the version that doesn't have the destruction. So it won't overwrite the (MBR) and you don't need to run it on a Virtual Machine or a Sandbox. Just choose your preference...

# 🎮 How do I play the MBR game?
To control Pac-Man, use the keyboard arrows. If you have a 60% Size Keyboard and you don't have arrows. Just cry about it.
